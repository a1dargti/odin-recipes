      Pelmeni are Russian meat-filled dumplings. Making them is a favorite
      family pastime during the long winter months. These dumplings are a common
      convenience food. Large batches can be frozen and quickly boiled or fried
      on demand. We usually double this recipe in our house and fold about 200
      pieces. Pelmeni are usually served with sour cream or vinegar.
